## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I struggled a lot with hiding/showing the social media buttons bubble, because I just didn't feel it right to only show it when it is clicked. But I hope I nailed it.
- I learned new JavaScript methods, such as SetTimeOut, ClearTimeout
